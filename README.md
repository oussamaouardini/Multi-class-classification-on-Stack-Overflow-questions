# Multi-class-classification-on-Stack-Overflow-questions
This notebook trains train a multi-class classifier to predict the tag of a programming question on Stack Overflow, based on the text of the question.

A dataset has been prepared for you to use containing the body of several thousand programming questions (for example, "How can I sort a dictionary by value in Python?") posted to Stack Overflow. Each of these is labeled with exactly one tag (either Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java). Your task is to take a question as input, and predict the appropriate tag, in this case, Python.
